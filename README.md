# Parallel Computing
## Priority
### Bounce
This is a program for simulating the movement of billiard balls. The movement of each ball is reproduced in a separate thread. Upon entering the pocket, the ball disappears, and the corresponding thread completes its work. Red balls are created with a higher priority of the thread in which they move faster than blue ones. 
### Symbol
This is a program that prints characters in parallel. Synchronized access is used for the correct operation of threads when working simultaneously. The output one-by-one to the console was achieved.
